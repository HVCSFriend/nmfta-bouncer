## Firewall NMFTA Project

This is the README for the Bouncer Project.

Once I get things into a more finalized state, this will turn into more of a howto. Until then, a feature list:

* Basic IPv4 application functionality
  * Implemented with a UFW interface
  * Managed through REST API
  * Full CRUD features working for IPv4 hosts
* A very functional, if basic, GUI app
  * Hasn't been stress tested
  * Mostly for dev purposes

A lot of the stuff is currently setup to run on my specific lab setup, but it shouldn't be very hard to tweak to get running on any server.
